/*******************************************************************************
 * hwi_set_nicaddr
 * 
 * Unconditionally set the NIC (mac) address for the ethernet device
 * corresponding to <hwi_off> to <nic_addr>.
 * The API allows for the setting of a specific NIC instance in the case where
 * there could be more than 1 NIC address per ethernet device. Typically this
 * would not be the case and <nic_idx> will be 0 indicating the first instance
 * 
 * Returns: true if the specified tag was successfully set, otherwise false
