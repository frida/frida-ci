/*
* PPC85xx SOC devices
*
* This file contains names for all of the devices that may exists on any 85xx
* processor variant. Specifically, these are the internal devices that are part
* of the MPC85xx SOC and not board specific devices. Board specific devices
* are defined in a similarly named board specific file
* 
* The names are added to the hwinfo section of the syspage (at the discretion of
* the startup writer) so that drivers can use hwi_find_device() to determine
* the existence of SOC device instances in a portable fashion and optionally
* retrieve device specific information like interrupt vectors, etc.
* 
* Not all of the devices are on every processor so hwi_find_device() may return
* HWI_NULL_OFF if a device, or device instance (ie. unit) is not found.

 * NOTE: we define PPC85xx_HWI_LEGACY_TSEC to be backwards compatible with

 * 		 Normally this legacy name would be added as a synonym and all would be
 * 		 well. However, the devn drivers not only search for the hardcoded name
 * 		 "tsec", they search using hwi_find_item() which does not resolve synonyms.
 * 		 Therefore, we need the primary name of the TSEC devices to be "tsec" and
 * 		 we will make an alias for the preferred name "eTSEC". In the future if
 * 		 we get the devn drivers moved over to using hwi_find_device() then either
 * 		 name will work.
