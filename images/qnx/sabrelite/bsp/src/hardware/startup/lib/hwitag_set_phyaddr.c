 * hwi_set_phyaddr

 * Unconditionally set the PHY address for the ethernet device corresponding to
 * <hwi_off> to <phy_addr>.
 * The API allows for the setting of a specific PHY in the case where there
 * could be more than 1 PHY per ethernet device. Typically this would not be
 * the case and <phy_idx> will be 0 indicating the first instance
 * 
 * Returns: true if the specified tag was successfully set, otherwise false
