 * Configuration for non-MPCore Cortex-A9 implementations:
 * - cache/page callouts use normal ARMv7 operations
 * - pte encodings use normal ARMv7 encodings
 *
 * NOTE: we need to set bit 10 (ARM_MMU_CR_F) to enable swp instructions.
 *       These were deprecated in ARMv6 and Cortex-A9 disables them by
 *       default causing them to generate illegal instruction exceptions.
