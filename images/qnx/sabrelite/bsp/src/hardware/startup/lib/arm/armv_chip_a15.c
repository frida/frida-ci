 * Configuration for Cortex-A15 MPCore:
 * - cache/page callouts use inner-cacheable/broadcast operations
 * - pte encodings use Shared/Write-back/Write-allocate encodings
 *
 * NOTE: we need to set bit 10 (ARM_MMU_CR_F) to enable swp instructions.
 *       These were deprecated in ARMv6 and Cortex-A15 disables them by
 *       default causing them to generate illegal instruction exceptions.
 *
 *       We also need to explicitly specify ARM_MMU_CR_XP even though that
 *       bit is always set to 1 by hardware so that arm_pte.c can detect
 *       that we are using the ARMv6 VMSA page table format.
