/*******************************************************************************
 * hwi_set_ivecrange
 * 
 * Unconditionally set the interrupt vector range attribute for the device
 * corresponding to <hwi_off>.
 * The API allows for the setting of a specific range block in the case where
 * there could be more than block of interrupt vectors per device. Typically
 * this would not be the case and <ivecrange_idx> will be 0 indicating the first
 * instance
 * 
 * Returns: true if the specified tag was successfully set, otherwise false
