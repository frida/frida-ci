/*
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Use the CP15 register 7 "Wait for Interrupt" to halt the processor.
 *
 * On entry:
 *	r0 - pointer to syspage_entry
 *	r1 - flag (currently always 0)
 *
 * NOTE : currently, this callout is only called from the ARM specific halt()
 *        function in the kernel. If this becomes used for a general purpose
 *        power management facility, we will need to handle arguments.
