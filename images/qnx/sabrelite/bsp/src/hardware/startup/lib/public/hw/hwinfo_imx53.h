/*
* IMX53 SOC devices
*
* This file contains names for all of the devices that may exists on any IMX53
* processor variant. Specifically, these are the internal devices that are part
* of the IMX53 SOC and not board specific devices. Board specific devices
* are defined in a similarly named board specific file
* 
* The names are added to the hwinfo section of the syspage (at the discretion of
* the startup writer) so that drivers can use hwi_find_device() to determine
* the existence of SOC device instances in a portable fashion and optionally
* retrieve device specific information like interrupt vectors, etc.
* 
* Not all of the devices are on every processor so hwi_find_device() may return
* HWI_NULL_OFF if a device, or device instance (ie. unit) is not found.
