/*
* EP93xx SOC devices
*
* This file contains names for all of the devices that may exists on any Cirrus
* Logic EP93xx processor variant. Specifically, these are the internal devices
* that are part of the EP93xx SOC and not board specific devices. Board specific
* devices are defined in a similarly named board specific file
* 
* The names are added to the hwinfo section of the syspage (at the discretion of
* the startup writer) so that drivers can use hwi_find_xxx() to determine
* the existence of SOC bus/device instances in a portable fashion and optionally
* retrieve device specific information like interrupt vectors, etc.
* 
* Not all of the devices are on every processor so hwi_find_xxx() may return
* HWI_NULL_OFF if a bus/device, or bus/device instance (ie. unit) is not found.
