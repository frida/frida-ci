#ifndef _HWINFO_H_
#define _HWINFO_H_

#include <hw/sysinfo.h>

/*
* This file contains the 'hwinfo' API's for common devices and their attributes.
* Processor architecture specific device API's are contained in a corresponding
* <cpu arch>/hwinfo.h file (ex. ppc/hwinfo.h) while processor/family specific
* device API's are contained in a hwinfo_<cpu>.h file (ex. hwinfo_85xx.h).
* (Note that the latter naming is used because we currently don't break down
* startup lib the files into 'cpu' specific directories, for example
* ppc/85xx/hwinfo.h although in the future we may want to) 
* 
* For each supported device, all of the common attribute tags are created as well
* a the tags specific to the device class. In order to remain portable and
* flexible without over complicating the interface, some of the created tags are
* not actually initialized to specific values. This is true for tags which may
* have multiple instances for the particular device but the number of instances
* would be device, board or cpu specific, for example the number of interrupt
* vectors for a given ethernet device.
* 
* To accomodate this, instead of trying to implement a variable sized data
* structure which passes in all of the attribute values for all of the instances
* of a particular attribute tag, instead the interface allows the caller to
* specify for such attributes the number of tags to be created. The caller can
* then initialize each of those tag instances with device, board or cpu specific
* and/or calculated values after the entry is created. In this way, we also only
* create the number of attribute tags we need for a given board.
* 
* Implementation Note
* 
* Note that this implementation (ie. placeholder tags) is a result of the fact
* that when tags are scanned starting from a specific device offset, it is
* assumed that the tags belonging to that device, follow that device. It's a bit
* clumsy but that's the way it was originally implemented. There is no way to
* validate that a tag belongs to a specific device (ie. item) since there is no
* owner field for tags and therefore the assumption is that the tags belonging
* to a device follow it and this is why all tags must be created at the time
* the device is created.
