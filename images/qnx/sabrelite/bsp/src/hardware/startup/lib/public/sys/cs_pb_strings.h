/************************************************************
These defines represent the different hardware features a playbook board
can support. If the board supports the feature startup sets a typed string
in the syspage for that feature with the string value "1". If the board 
doesn't support the feature the string is set to "0". The configuration 
strings can be accessed in an application using confstr with the appropriate
string number i.e confstr(CS_PB_TOUCH_CONTROL_POWER_GPIO)
