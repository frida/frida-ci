In this case our full IPL is not involved. The image is loaded into memory
and transfered to by an existing BIOS IPL. Since the existing IPL does not
know where in startup tp jump it always jumps to the start of the image.
We build a tiny IPL on the front of the image which jumps to startup_vaddr.

Bank Switched ROM
=================
This is much like a Disk/Network boot except you get to write the code
which copies the image into RAM using.

checksum(image_paddr, startup_size)
checksum(image_paddr + startup_size, stored_size - startup_size)
copy(image_paddr, ram_paddr, copy_size)
jump(startup_vaddr)
goto Disk/Network or Disk/Network Compressed

You will need to map the physical addresses and sizes into bank switching
as needed. Have fun and next time DON'T BANK SWITCH YOUR ROM! Make it linear
in the address space.
